    <h1  <b> Soccer </b></h1>
    <p> In soccer there are two teams of eleven players. Soccer is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal. ... One of the reasons soccer is so popular is that it really only takes a ball and a flat open area to play.</p>
